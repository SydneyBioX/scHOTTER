#' Identify "light" kernels with too few unique points
#'
#' Flags kernels that don't have enough assigned points relative to how many
#' other kernels they overlap with. The criterion used is
#' \code{num_points < num_overlaps}, where \code{num_points} is the column sum
#' of the (0/1) membership matrix and \code{num_overlaps} is the length of the
#' overlap set for that kernel (typically including itself).
#'
#' @param overlapping_list A named list where each element \code{overlapping_list[[k]]}
#'   is a character vector of kernel names that overlap kernel \code{k}. See
#'   \code{\link{determine_overlaps}}.
#' @param membership_matrix A 0/1 matrix (preferably \code{Matrix::dgCMatrix})
#'   of pointâ€“kernel memberships with rows = points, cols = kernels.
#'
#' @return A character vector of kernel names deemed "light".
#'
#' @details
#' This function assumes the overlap list includes each kernel itself (as produced
#' by \code{determine_overlaps()}). If you supply an overlap list that excludes
#' self, the threshold will be one smaller; adjust upstream if needed.
