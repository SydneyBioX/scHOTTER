Description: scHOTTER is a package that implements kernel-based local correlation analysis for gene pairs and an analytic null for the sample variance of Fisher z correlations across kernels that comprises a parametric alternative to Ghazanfar et al.'s single-cell higher-order testing (scHOT) methodology (Ghazanfar et al., 2020). This pipeline offers improvements in computational efficiency and statistical power, supports both 2D spatial and 1D trajectory (1D) data, and provides a high-level pipeline with access to all intermediate results.
